    "description": "<p>Recently we have been working closely with Keller Williams to create digital tools which will empower their real estate agents to be successful. Our goal has been to not only solve for the agent workflow challenges, but also to craft a delightful experience in a space where products lean more towards utilitarian in functionality and tone. </p>\n\n<p>This example shows a flow from the CRM we are building in which a user is creating a new opportunity within the system. Our team has worked to create a visual language that injects a fresh and inviting tone within usually mundane actions. </p>\n\n<p>Follow us as we continue to work with Keller Williams to create and evolve their digital tools of the future.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to the design team working on product: <a href=\"https://dribbble.com/299472\">@Kade Schemahorn</a> <a href=\"https://dribbble.com/1068166\">@Justin Rey</a> Willy Morgan and to <a href=\"https://dribbble.com/216043\">@Christine Soules</a> for the illustrations.</p>",
